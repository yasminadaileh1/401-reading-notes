## Ducks: Redux Reducer Bundles

### Rules

A module...

1. MUST `export default` a function called `reducer()`
2. MUST `export` its action creators as functions
3. MUST have action types in the form `npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE`
3. MAY export its action types as `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, if an external reducer needs to listen for them, or if it is a published reusable library

These same guidelines are recommended for `{actionType, action, reducer}` bundles that are shared as reusable Redux libraries.


### Usage

You can still do:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import * as reducers from './ducks/index';

const rootReducer = combineReducers(reducers);
export default rootReducer;
```

You can still do:

```javascript
import * as widgetActions from './ducks/widgets';
```
...and it will only import the action creators, ready to be passed to `bindActionCreators()`.

> Actually, it'll also import `default`, which will be the reducer function. It'll add an action creator named `default` that won't work. If that's a problem for you, you should enumerate each action creator when importing.

There will be some times when you want to `export` something other than an action creator. That's okay, too. The rules don't say that you can *only* `export` action creators. When that happens, you'll just have to enumerate the action creators that you want. Not a big deal.

```javascript
import {loadWidgets, createWidget, updateWidget, removeWidget} from './ducks/widgets';
// ...
bindActionCreators({loadWidgets, createWidget, updateWidget, removeWidget}, dispatch);
```
## Redux Toolkit
The makers of Redux have recognized that Redux is complicated and have introduced a “Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated” framework for making stores called the Redux Toolkit

This toolkit specifies a few different means of building a reducer and action set that work well together and are easier to understand and integrate
