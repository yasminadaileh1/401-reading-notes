## How to Solve Programming Problems :white_check_mark:

If you have heard the saying &ldquo; measure twice and cut once, &ldquor; then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.
In programming this mean you need to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

### A simple set of steps :feet:
set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.


#### step 1:  Read the problem completely twice :eyes:
You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else,If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.

#### step 2: Solve the problem manually :key:
It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate and  solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.

#### step 3: Optimize the manual steps :bulb:
What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

#### step 4: Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code :page_facing_up:
What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

#### step 5: Replace comments with real code :pencil2:
If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:
1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

#### step 6: Optimize the real code :microscope:
Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.


## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive :moneybag:

### what if you placed a high value on your time? 
Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness 
We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins:
&ldquo; The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.&ldquor;

### Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy 
 They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.
 Do you want incredible productivity?
Then cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.

### As You Think, So You Are
If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
&ldquo;&ldquo;  “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” .&ldquor;&ldquor;— Steve Jobs

Problem solving is the meta-skill.
system to how you “solve” problems:
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

#### Have a framework :green_book:
what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
1. Understand: When you can explain it that mean you are understanding the problem.
2. Plan: this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
3. Divide: break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
4. are you Stuck? then debug 


#### Practice :arrows_counterclockwise:
Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with simplification.”
