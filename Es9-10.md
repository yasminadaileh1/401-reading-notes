## what is finally() 
The `finally()` method returns a Promise. When the promise is settled, either fulfilled or rejected, the specified **callback function is executed**. This provides a way for code **to be run** whether the promise was fulfilled successfully or rejected **once the Promise has been dealt with**.

## syntax
`es9.finally(onFinally);`
this mean onFinally will be called when the Promise is settled.

## .finally VS .then

The finally() method is very **similar** to calling .then() however there are a **couple of differences**:

1. When creating a function inline, you can pass it once, instead of being forced to either declare it twice, or create a variable for it.
1. A finally callback will not receive any argument, since there's no reliable means of determining if the promise was fulfilled or rejected. 

which mean :
`Promise.resolve(2).then(() => {}, () => {})` (will be resolved with undefined), 
`Promise.resolve(2).finally(() => {})` will be resolved with 2.
